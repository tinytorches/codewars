// Beginner Series #5 Triangular Numbers
// Triangular number is the amount of points that can fill equilateral triangle. 
// Example: the number 6 is a triangular number because all sides of a triangle has the same amount of points.
// Given a number 'T' from interval [1; 2147483646], find if it is triangular number or not.

// Hint!
// T(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2,
// n - is the size of one side.
// T(n) - is the triangular number.

const isTriangular = (t) => {
    let 
}

// each following row increases by 1
// have to have the ability to measure each side separately and compare
// if equal, return true


// loop
